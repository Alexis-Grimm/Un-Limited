# Un-Limited
A Rimworld mod that Un-Limits certain pawn stats.
Basically rimworld will limit how much health capacities can effect your pawns various stat.
For instance a pawns manipulation will effect research speed. Any manipulation over 100% will improve research speed.
However, in vanilla, manipulation can only have so much of an effect, so the effect of a pawns 110% manipulation and 700% manipulation on research speed will be exactly the same. Essentially rendering it pointless to give your researchers bionic limbs. This is true for a large quanity of the stats and health capacities in rimworld, not just manipulation and research speed.
Also some stats have a maximum that can be reached, for instance mining yield can only reach 100%, this mod removes these sorts of limitations as well so that your bionically enhanced colonists can truly transcend the limitations of flesh.

Also this mod uses ModCheck, This mod includes the dll file for mod check so that you do not have to download it yourself, however it is generally better that you do:

(It currently does not use ModCheck for Rimworld 1.1, but still does for Rimworld 1.0)
